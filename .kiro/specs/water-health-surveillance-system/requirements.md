# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive Water Quality and Health Surveillance System. The system will serve as a government platform for monitoring waterborne diseases, tracking water quality issues, and coordinating emergency responses. It will provide real-time monitoring capabilities, data analytics, and reporting tools for health officials and field workers to manage public health threats related to water contamination.

4. WHEN there are active alerts THEN the system SHALL display alert notifications in the header

### Requirement 2: Water Quality Report Submission

**User Story:** As a field worker, I want to submit water quality reports with testing data and images, so that I can document water contamination issues and quality assessments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN submitting a water quality report THEN the system SHALL require location details, water source information, and testing parameters
2. WHEN uploading test results THEN the system SHALL accept pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, and other water quality parameters
3. WHEN adding location data THEN the system SHALL integrate with Leaflet maps for precise location selection
4. WHEN uploading images THEN the system SHALL accept and store image files related to the water source
5. WHEN saving a report THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields and store the data in MongoDB

### Requirement 3: Patient Report Submission

**User Story:** As a healthcare worker, I want to report suspected waterborne disease cases, so that I can contribute to disease surveillance and outbreak detection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN submitting a patient report THEN the system SHALL require patient information, symptoms, and suspected water source
2. WHEN entering symptoms THEN the system SHALL provide predefined symptom categories (diarrhea, vomiting, cholera symptoms, etc.)
3. WHEN linking to water sources THEN the system SHALL allow selection from existing water quality reports or manual entry
4. WHEN marking severity THEN the system SHALL categorize cases as mild, moderate, or severe
5. WHEN saving patient data THEN the system SHALL comply with health data privacy requirements

### Requirement 4: Analytics and Investigation Hub

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want powerful analytics tools to identify patterns and trends, so that I can support decision-making and outbreak investigations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing analytics THEN the system SHALL provide date range filters, location filters, and symptom filters
2. WHEN viewing health cases data THEN the system SHALL display case ID, date, location, symptoms, water source, age group, and severity
3. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL provide export functionality for further analysis
4. WHEN switching between views THEN the system SHALL offer both Data Explorer and Trend Analysis modes
5. WHEN filtering data THEN the system SHALL update results in real-time

### Requirement 5: Reports Documentation Hub

**User Story:** As a supervisor, I want to view and manage surveillance reports, so that I can track documentation and ensure proper reporting procedures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing reports THEN the system SHALL display a searchable library of all generated reports
2. WHEN viewing report details THEN the system SHALL show metadata including author, generation date, period covered, and file formats
3. WHEN searching reports THEN the system SHALL filter by title, description, author, category, and status
4. WHEN downloading reports THEN the system SHALL provide multiple format options (PDF, CSV, Excel)
5. WHEN categorizing reports THEN the system SHALL support surveillance, investigation, and other report types

### Requirement 6: Alerts and Action Hub

**User Story:** As an emergency response coordinator, I want real-time alerts for critical water quality issues, so that I can coordinate immediate response actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN water quality parameters exceed thresholds THEN the system SHALL generate automatic alerts
2. WHEN viewing alerts THEN the system SHALL categorize them by Water Quality, Health Clusters, and Query Response
3. WHEN an alert is critical THEN the system SHALL highlight it with appropriate visual indicators
4. WHEN responding to alerts THEN the system SHALL provide options to view details, send alerts, and assign teams
5. WHEN alerts are resolved THEN the system SHALL update status and maintain audit trail

### Requirement 7: Directory and Resource Management

**User Story:** As a coordinator, I want to manage directories of health centers and NGO partners, so that I can maintain contact information and coordinate responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing directories THEN the system SHALL display ASHA Centers and NGO Partners in separate tabs
2. WHEN viewing center details THEN the system SHALL show lead worker, contact information, coverage area, and status
3. WHEN searching directories THEN the system SHALL filter by center name, district, or worker name
4. WHEN updating contact information THEN the system SHALL maintain change history
5. WHEN viewing coverage THEN the system SHALL display population served and geographical area

### Requirement 8: Interactive Mapping with Leaflet

**User Story:** As a field coordinator, I want interactive maps showing disease outbreaks and water sources, so that I can visualize geographical patterns and coordinate field responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing maps THEN the system SHALL use Leaflet API for interactive mapping functionality
2. WHEN displaying data layers THEN the system SHALL show Water Bodies, Outbreak Areas, Clinics & Hospitals, and NGOs
3. WHEN viewing outbreak areas THEN the system SHALL color-code regions by risk level (high, medium, low)
4. WHEN clicking map markers THEN the system SHALL display detailed information popups
5. WHEN filtering map data THEN the system SHALL update markers and overlays in real-time
6. WHEN displaying patient reports THEN the system SHALL mark patient locations with circular overlays
7. WHEN multiple patient cases exist in an area THEN the system SHALL increase circle radius proportionally to case density
8. WHEN viewing patient case circles THEN the system SHALL color-code circles by severity (mild=green, moderate=yellow, severe=red)
9. WHEN clicking patient case circles THEN the system SHALL display popup with case count, severity breakdown, and recent cases
10. WHEN patient data updates THEN the system SHALL dynamically update circle sizes and colors in real-time

### Requirement 9: Data Storage and Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want reliable data storage and management, so that I can ensure data integrity and system performance.
